                (Taken Straight From My Steam Review)

                The weapons and gear are really cool, but this is not for the light hearted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the entire DLC, with my souls level 170 character I was being killed in 3 hits, thats fine,
                Ill use the new leveling system, it helps but still getting 4 shot. Surely it gets better I tell myself,
                so I push through the game masking the endless vessel of rage Im slowly becoming. After getting to a certain
                dragon boss, the final boss, and another boss I shall not name, the game has finally broken me to my core
                fundamental particles: rage, cope, and hopelessness. I struggle on because surely I'll never have to play
                this again, the rage only building on the inside. I've come to realize that the only thing less dodge-able
                than a constant never ending boss combos and stamina bar, is my hopelessness. The only thing keeping me going
                is a 2 minute all hit video, I think "if he can take all the hits and win, surely I can play the game with my
                build", this is followed by me walking into the arena and dying before I have time to attack -- great.
            </p>
                The environments never really get boring, compared to the base game, all of the dungeons and caves are much
            larger than they were; this works well with the graves/dungeons, but less so with the caves. The caves I feel
            didn't have much character, they were just big. The castles are one of the things I love most. The map is very
            dense with structures and I love it -- especially the castles.
            </p>
            <p>
                The weapons are all really cool, there are a couple new types as well. Throughout my ever growing hopelessness
                build play-through, a lot of the weapons I found were either a new type of weapon, or a old type with a brand new
                move set. Hand-to-Hand weapons being my favorite, they are one of the things that kept me going, especially the
                kick based weapon. I found the game much more enjoyable once I walked away from the boss into a field to kick
                the innocent civilians of the shadow lands in the throat. As a dropkick meta enjoyer since the dying light
                days, this weapons is perfect -- between kicking old men in the throat and flying/dropping axe kicking birds,
                I was actually able to smile.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main issue with the DLC is how difficult it is, every fight is like a 3 v 1, me versus the boss, camera,
                and my own cpu. The boss alone is difficult, because why not right? This is only made worse when my camera
                cant properly allow me to sight read the next attack, if you recall earlier, this is not okay because the
                bosses grab me by the balls and squeeze till they hear 2 concurrent pops making me either die instantly or
                in a more hopeful view, get reduced to a frantic tarnished who has to dodge the rest of the 6 hit combo
                followed by 200 miliseconds of downtime. One thing I do love about SOME bosses are there presentation,
                Midra and Messmer (M&M if you will) both have cutscenes that I love, Midra a little more because my favorite
                base game ending was frenzied flame, both bosses also have really nice designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I took a 12 hour brake to think about my feelings on the DLC and a lot of it comes down to me having
                the expectations of a Darksouls style boss fight rather than an Elden Ring styled fight. Elden ring
                has a lot more AOE and combo attacks, I generally love the base game bosses, Mohg being one of my
                favorites, and I can say to a great extent most of those bosses feel fair and their difficulty can be
                overcome. With the DLC I feel that the bosses are like the bosses were cranked up to an ungodly amount.
                Souls extremists on both ends of the spectrum will say either "git good"(the standard),
                "the bosses weren't that hard", "I beat him after (insert sub 10) times" or on the other end of the spectrum
                (honest to god, I saw a real comment on reddit which I will paraphrase) "I encountered the boss at blessing
                level 4, I finally beat him after 14+ hours" -- that is insane dedication which I can respect, however
                between getting sexually assaulted by the final boss or going to work for 8 hours and actually making money
                there is a clear winner.

                This whole review can be summed up by saying, I am probably the problem, but I also dont want to change
                my entire build Ive used for 70 hours to beat 1 boss. I should not have to change my morals, ethics,
                political spectrum, chemical makeup, career path, and nervous system to beat a boss. I would love to
                play with my playstyle and not have to post a melancholic review at 2:30 am after being sent through
                hell and back fighting these bosses. Alas I am God's strongest soldier and he has given me his hardest task.
                I am Sisyphus and this god forsaken DLC is my boulder.
            </p>
            <p>
                But again, the weapons are cool and I love throat kicking the innocent and homeless. 7/10
                (for now, we'll see if I change my mind after all my pain and suffering, or if I just wither away and
                rot in my own filth until I am nothing but a vessel for infinite suffering).
            </p>
            <p>
                (Post Victory Edit:)
            <p>
                Turns out my morals are not as strong as I thought they were, I shield poked the final boss becasue
            I didnt want to go through the hassle of being 1-shot for hours on end. I found the bosses incredibly
            difficult compared to all other souls games so just to be sure Im playing through the series so far,
            and suprise suprise darksouls is FUN with GOOD BOSS DESIGN. Even the bed of chaos was more fun than half
            of the bosses.
            </p>

            <p>
                Realistically, my views have grow on how darksouls is supposed to be played, I think that the typical
                knight build is heavily encouraged (and is my prefered way to play), but this game is your game -- play
                it how you feel, and whatever brings you joy.
            </p>

            <p>
                I think people are missing the point of the Darksouls and Elden ring series, its not so much about
                "ITS SUPPOSE TO BE DIFFICULT STOP BEING A PUSSY" -- your argument is flimsy and you have terminal brain
                worms for such a surface level take on a complex series, you are no better than "GIT GUD" bros,
                and your elitism is a plight to the gaming community.
            </p>
                The real point of Darksouls and Elden ring is overcoming challenges, sure difficulty is a large
                factor in that but that doesn't mean it has to be the focus. Degenerate brain wormed cretins will
                disagree because their skull consumes 99% of the mass of their dense head. I loved darksouls and
                demon souls, and they are very hit-or-miss when it comes to difficulty (I struggled with tower knight,
                but killed most other bosses in 2 tries). What made those games enjoyable was not their difficulty,
                but it was their ability for me to grasp that a challenge was possible, in this DLC,
                the bosses were a little too much for me, and I could not grasp a sense of possibility.
