            Out of all the things that can get a person "in the mood", there is one that stands above the rest and I think we
            can all agree on this one: Academic Honesty (followed closely by research capability). Here's how to become a sexy
            academic

        <h1>1. Look For Readers</h1>
        <p>
            One thing that can "extend the rod", and by rod, well lets just say peanits. Is to become a reader.
            Scientist have revealed that looking at a book is a great way to increase research capacity. But don't look
            to excited: you're "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions 3rd Edition" is hot, but dont look too desprite!
            Try reading a line or two, then writing about it. Try reading a line or two, then writing about it again.
            Try reading a line or two, then again try writing about it. If you keeep doing this you'll surely stand out in the
            crowd of non-academics (unlike yourself)

        <h1>2. Point The Book's Title Towards Them</h1>
        <p>
            We all subconsiously turn the face of a book away from us while reading because that's how books work you intellect
            deficient homunculus, but worry not, once you have that step down, the next is to make sure the title is pointed
            towards your peer of interest. Book choice also matters. Any scientific journal would work so long as it has a hard
            cover and it's title's font size is greater than 40pt (aditional points for golden colored text), but do avoid
            books for the masses such as "Atomic Habits", read those in your spare time to not be embarresed on the university
            grounds.

        <h1>3. Point Your Pencil At Them </h1>
        <p>
            The more items (whether conected to your body or not) that are pointed towards them, the more likely you look
            like that super sexy researcher everyone dreams about. Pencils, rulers, arms (do not point anywhere above shoulder
            level), fingers, freaky people might use bare toes. Realistically the choice is yours so long as your pointing at
            least 3-5 things at them (including the book)
        </p>

        <h1>4. Dilate Your Pupils</h1>
        <p>
            A little known fact is that when you see someone you like, your pupils dialate (probably some chemical thing,
            we'll leave that to the neuro-chemists to fact-check). You dont want to make your peer of interest think that
            its because of them, because that seems to desprite, so you'll need a high-powered military flashlight and a dark
            room.
        </p>
        <p>
            First you must stare into the flashlight for 5 seconds to around 1 minute, the choice is yours. Next walk into a
            really dark room, this theoretically should make your pupils dialate, but since you don't want to look desprite
            the darkness in the room should completely make your eyes invisible. The hard part is getting your love interest
            into the completely dark room and also meeting them there whilst following steps 1-3. For some street cred you
            can drop your "Herzberg atomic spectroscopy volume 1" in front of them -- they won't know what happened because
            of the blinding darkness but you sure will, and that's pretty sick my dude ðŸ¤™.

        <h1>5. DO NOT SMILE!</h1>
        <p>
            You want to look like a normal, stable, human being, so to avoid sending mixed signals you must read your research
            papers/book with the largest frown imaginable. People expect you to smile when you do something you love, research
            is not very lovable. This will tell your person that you are a normal human who hates studying but pushes through.
            You can also try slaming your hands on desks, flipping tables, or the classic "shinji pose" (on the chair)

            I started this as a silly little parody of

        <h1>7. Say The Name Of Important Documents And References From Throughout History</h1>
        <p>
            This is a big one, so remember it! When talking to peer (who by now should be ripping their pants off), make sure
            to throw in the name of a few historical documents and references. Some classics:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"This reminds me of the magna carta!" -- A Classic</li>
            <li>"Yeah! I actually read that in Meditations by Marcus Aurelius!" -- A Very Safe Play</li>
            <li>"What is this? Nazi Germany?" -- Implies A Certain Level Of Sexual Desire</li>
            <li>"Reminds me of the 15th rule of power: 'Crush your enemy totally'!" -- A Good Choice To Imply Dominance</li>
            <li>"â™ª Conjunction junction what's your function â™ª" -- Instant Sheet Shaker </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Really linger over the sound of it. Draw it out. Use your most sultry, sexy, and husky voice</h1>
        <p>Same Examples From Before, But More Sexy</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"This reminds me of the magnaaa cartaaa -- I loveee taking power from the king in 1215"</li>
            <li>"Yas! I actually read that in Meditationssss by Marcus Aureliussss!"</li>
            <li>"What is thissss? Naziii Germanyyyy?"</li>
            <li>"Reminds me of the 15th rule of powerrrr: 'Crush your enemyyyy totallyyy'!"</li>
            <li>
                "â™ª Conjunction junction what's your function â™ª" -- This One Stays Unchanged
                Because Its Effective No Matter The Tone or Vibe Of The Conversation
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>8. Touch Them -- But Make It Look Like An Accident</h1>
        <p>
            Being the academic you are, you should have enough resources on you to find a reason for physical touch.
            My favorite is "throwing" my Communist Manifesto at the person, naturally they go to help you pick it up.
            This is where you slide your hands meet on the manifesto. And of course with your level of academic rigor
            they'll take notice.
        </p>
        <p>"You also read the complete works of Carl Marx"</p>
        <p>"Damn straight"</p>
