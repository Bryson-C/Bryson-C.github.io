            I now fear god, for what god would allow cmake to exist as it doth presently.
            This is not a friendly god by any means, no, rather, this is a god who his strongest
            battle (using 3rd party c/c++ code), to his funniest clown (me)

            God is supposedly an all-loving being, let propose this is true. Let's also assume that
            God is under the classical determinist view. Okay, now that you are primed, consider this:
            Why is cmake real? Why did we -- and by we I mean we were the vessels allowing evil to tranish
            the sacred code-scape -- let this happen? God's plan is not a plan, its a divine comedy and we
            are the punchline.

            Perhaps I am the stupid one, but whenever it comes down to using 3rd party code, I would rather "roll my own"
            because the alternative (cmake) consistantly makes me want to kill myself. Is cmake just a skill check and
            I never got the memo? Surely this isn't the best option out there right?

            You want to know the real sad thing though? It's not just C and C++, every godforsaken week Im back
            in the same position: "I really don't want to figure out how to decode some propriatary data format
            (or really just daunting tasks I don't want to reinvent the wheel for), I'll just get some code off
            of github". The smartest of you already know my first mistake started 8 years ago when I decided I
            wanted to do coding as a career rather than agriculture or any other blue collar profession. So I
            type something like "cargo install [package name]". 300+ crates? Why do I do this to myself anymore?

            So lets get back to why god is evil and developers are a proxy for said evil on this planet.
            I have seen past the veil of libraries and frameworks -- there are 2 options:
            1. I have essentially been intellectually pay-walled and I don't understand why we need thousands of
            files and dependencies or 2. We don't actually need thousands of files and dependencies and the devil
            actaully reveals himself for code-bases.
        </p>
        <p>
            God is not a man or a woman, God is a creature to be feared, a tyrant with an ironfist. But Again,
            back to the evil of God and his relationship with cmake. Perhaps we cant find God because the search
            for a God is what will reveal him, but there is another school of thought: developers are the laughingstock
            of the divinity, and cmake was a tool for obscuring God.

            I'm not even religious mind you, but buildtools are the kind of tools that make you want to pray to
            a divine being to make the pain stop. The pain does not stop, the pain only gets worse. Unfortunately,
            this ever-worsening pain is never truly dealt with (it seems every build tool is just a wrapper around
            cmake, so the problem never solves itself), but we learn to cope with the evil plauging our code-bases.
