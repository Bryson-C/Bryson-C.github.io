    IDEAS:
    <ul>
      <li> Companies run games, no one controls sports </li>
      <li> Its a physical competition by design (or at least implied to be) </li>
      <li>
        Even some sports in the olympics probably dont deserve a spot
        <ul>
          <li>
            Such as golf: Golf alread has the PGA -- I always hear about that, but never olympic golf
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Physical sports are more difficult (subjectively) </li>
      <li> The line-up of games sucks balls (if rainbow 6 siege was better, itd be the perfect canidate) </li>
      <li> Games constantly change, sports rarely change </li>
      <li> Why does gaming deserve a spot over other mental sports such as chess?</li>

      <li>
        Gaming should get its own major event instead of being retrofitted into the olympics
        <ul>
          <li>Again golf has the PGA tour (or something stupid like that), why cant esports have the same? </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    <li>Who selects the teams? The government? Private teams -- if thats the case then that can limit the diversity of players (in terms of teams)</li>
    <li>How many teams are sent per nation per game?</li>
    <li>How will less developed nations compete on an even playing field -- itd be battle of the first world nation if not</li>
    </ul>
