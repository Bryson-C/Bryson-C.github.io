                Im as much of a fan of the new government programs as the next guy. I love the new import laws
                for tropical fish, I love the price drops in grocery stores, and of course the new school programs
                are a life saver. This is a true game changer, and if we get more programs and government aid like
                this, then the United States is going to be the next super power (again): watch out China.

                As much as I love the new government laws/programs, I can't help but feel a little urked by some of
                the new additions. Like always, there were some weird things attached to the bill to help it pass:
                call it bribery from the inside to pass both parties in congresss. Back in my days it was "You want
                more women's rights? Well, thats fine so long as we can also send 30 trillion to Macedonia", it 
                was the nature of the beast back then, but time are changing, and Im changing too.

                I was walking to the store with my food stamps in hand admiring our great nation, but even more so
                the new additions that the laws have given to my town. I looked at the new tropical fish in the park's
                pond, the newly paved roads, and the playground for the children in the park: it reminded me of when I
                was young. As I passed the swamp of infinite industrial waste and cardinogens (mandated by the new 
                bill passed of course). Because of how green the park had become, it had become a new safe space for me.

                I finally got to the grocery store and the automated turrets recognized me instantly (again, part of the bill),
                luckily me and the turrets have a sort of bro-ship, they would never dare hurt me. Everything was
                so cheap here: food stamps are the future.

                Later that night I was watching the news, and I couldn't help but think about the new programs. I love 
                the swamp of infinite waste, the imports, and the turrets: it truly makes the town feel more safe, but 
                I just cant get use to the space revolver. It's a beautiful space revolver, no doubt, but it was put up
                so suddenly: but I know in my heart I will come to love it, I feel it in my bones.

                Of course, for as much as I love the new laws, I cant help but feel uneasy about the "back-alley" 
                implementations such as the bottomless pit or the hyper-zipline. I seemed to have missed a few of 
                the new government mandated changes, some of which were beaurocratic mumbo jumbo such as "big 
                dope-ass cigars", "closet confetti cannons", and of course the new "one 'Why cant we just be chill 
                bro?' poster per room" (which is pretty rad not going to lie). But when I stumbled upon the "required malevolent
                all-seeing eye", I was a little taken aback. For as cool as they look, they are kind of scary: they don't blink,
                they don't really do anything, they always look at you, and worst of all -- they scoff at you when you do
                something stupid in a sort of "I wouldn't have done it like that" way.

                Its really going to take some time to warm up to the malevolent eye, but I think I'll come to find him
                a welcome guest in my house. Not to mention he makes a great space heater (being made out of pure fire and
                all). I have a week or so left to ponder the before the eye arrives, so now I just walk around and admire
                the wonders of nature: the trees, the grass, the fresh air, and of course the new installment of the
                40 foot titanium spike field.
